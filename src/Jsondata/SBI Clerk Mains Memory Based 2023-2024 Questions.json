In a world dominated by digital advancements, Rohan, a seasoned software engineer with thirty years of experience, decided to embark on a transformative journey. Eager to contribute to his family's legacy, he embarked on an agricultural journey alongside his brother. Together, they chose to cultivate millets, a crop that thrived in the village's climate and offered resistance to pests, aligning perfectly with their aspirations for sustainable farming.\nThe village's reliance on age-old farming tools and techniques posed a challenge for maximizing millet production. Recognizing the potential for modern technology to enhance agricultural efficiency, Rohan applied his engineering expertise to introduce innovative farming practices. His efforts were met with remarkable success, leading to a significant improvement in millet yields.\nRohan's achievements extended beyond his own fields. He became a catalyst for change, sharing his newfound agricultural knowledge with fellow villagers. His initiative to incorporate technology in farming sparked a collective advancement in agricultural practices within the community.\nUnderstanding the economic challenges faced by farmers due to intermediary exploitation, Rohan founded an agro-based company. This venture enabled direct transactions between farmers and the company, eliminating the need for middlemen and significantly increasing farmers' profits by 30%.\nThe village, once known for its traditional farming, gained recognition for its prolific millet production and innovative agricultural practices under Rohan's influence. His journey from a software engineer to a pioneering farmer exemplifies the power of blending technological innovation with traditional wisdom to foster community development and sustainability.

        "direction": "Read the following passage and answer the given questions.\nGermany's economic vigor is surmised to have attenuated by 0.3% in the annum 2023, aligning with autumnal prognostications. An erosion in purchasing power egregiously impinged upon private consumer expenditures. Escalated expenditures pertinent to construction and borrowing, compounded by a paucity of labor and pronounced energy costs, have effectively hamstrung investments in the construction ambit and industries characterized by prodigious energy consumption.\nIndices reflecting economic sentiment have remained in a state of torpor, with certain gauges in January descending to their lowest ebb since the COVID-19 pandemic's advent, signaling an economic expansion that is, at best, tepid in the initial half of 2024. The trajectory of investment growth is poised to continue its lag behind pre-pandemic standards, beleaguered by a dismal investor outlook at the year's outset. Labor shortages steadfastly remain a formidable barrier to economic activities, effectively squaring the circle in terms of reconciling growth aspirations with the reality of workforce constraints. The prospect of a trade-led revitalization appears tenuous, as exports and imports are anticipated to ascend at parallel magnitudes in the ensuing forecast intervals. More austere fiscal policies are poised to cast a pall over the near-term growth outlook. Contrariwise, a modicum of relief in market financing conditions has been noted, with anticipations of further amelioration in the offing.",
